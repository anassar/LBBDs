# LBBDs
Lattice-Based Boolean Diagrams (LBBDs) are a new graphical representations of Boolean functions (or any finite-valued functions).
This is a toolbox for symbolically manipulating Boolean functions based on LBBDs, with a powerful graphical interface that enables
reading Boolean functions in many formats (e.g., BLIF and DIMACS) and generates/displays DOT graphs of LBBDs and BDDs/ZDDs using an
embedded SVG graphics interpreter.

LBBDs were first published in (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=7428056&tag=1) and won a best-paper award.

LBBDs toolbox is written in Java. Source code can be provided upon request because it cannot currently be placed in the public domain
until we resolve license issues with other reused open-source modules.
